 


-hit animations still visible after animation over

-enemies don't take damage

-anything but the player that uses physics for being thrown or jumping never stops moving (thrown enemies and I suspect jumping treasure)
    -still gotta test barrels

-some tile collisions are broken (pegs and ceiling are the ones I noticed)

-ladders and death tile areas aren't being generated because they removed a tileset function I used for getting positions
    might be a good thing, gotta look up how to detect tiles directly... but I'm not sure it's better than using area signals... we'll see.

-saw a leak when closing the game: "ERROR: 2 RID allocations of type 'P11GodotBody2D' were leaked at exit."

-res://objects/generic/powerup.gd:49 - Invalid type in function 'play' in base 'AnimatedSprite2D'. Cannot convert argument 1 from Nil to StringName.
    -this is related to the glitter effect and /might/ have been an editor/tool error

-res://objects/generic/elevator.gd:123 - Invalid call. Nonexistent function 'get_font' in base 'Label'.

-something is triggering this when loading test_arena:
    "scene/resources/sprite_frames.cpp:216 - Condition "!f.has("texture")" is true. Continuing."

-inventory_manager is broken. At least it kinda shows contents

-sprites aren't being imported correctly (blurry)

-projectiles aren't being instantiated
    -actually, they are but they despawn immediately

-dynamite throw animation gets stuck on the last frame

-health items cannot be picked up, "no action for this area 'area2d'" (class name issue)
